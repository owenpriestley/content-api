# content-api

This was my first attempt at building a simple API in Node.js

Use the interface to `POST` and `GET` content. 

The app uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) to render markdown formatting into HTML.

Behind the scenes, content is stored and fetched from mLab.
